If you enter a blog or some content site, you got hit by a cookies uppercut, you
slip and than a newsletter jab.

Your are not a friendly user anymore, you are a **product**. Most sites lost the
purpose of the internet, share.

If you want to sell your stuffs, do it explicit! Not annoying a pedestrian
wandering in the crosswalk.

Blogs and sites that let you navigate openly and gather your content as they
want (rss.xml), have my respect! We are together.
