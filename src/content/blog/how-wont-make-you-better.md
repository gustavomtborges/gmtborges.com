One of the hottest word for titles out there is "How".

_How to create a machine learning model_\
_How to apply design patterns in your project_\
_How to create a k8s cluster_\
_How to ..._

Knowing "How" won't take you anywhere. "How" is procedural, a machine can reproduce.

Start asking **Why**

_Why is a machine learning model?_\
_Why do I need design patterns in my project?_\
_Why am I create a k8s cluster?_

"Why" will awaken your curiosity, a genuinely human ability.
And don't wait for "Why" posts. Go find yours.

Be more human, and you will be a better professional.
